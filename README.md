## The project needed these minimum equipments
- Arduino Mega
- CNC Shield v3
- Stepper motor
- Power Supply
- AD8832 and EMG electrodes
- 3D printed models from "assets" directory
- Bearings
- Potentiometer (For demonstration purposes, read below)

## NOTE : The "demo" directory was made for demonstration, using potentiometer for switching between the act of closing and opening of palm, with only one stepper working.
